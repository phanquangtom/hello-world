# hello-world

Hello everyone,

My name is Anh Quang Phan, an international student from Vietnam. I was born in a family of four, and I am the youngest brother in my family. Because my brother is not as "normal" as everyone else, I am the only person who can take care of my parents. I came to USA in 2016, when I was 17, and studied in Northern Virginia Community College for 2 years. Then, I transferred to George Mason University under the major of Computer Science. About myself, I don't consider myself to be the most confident human-being, but I am the most hard-working one. Coding came to me as naturally as any other person. I fell in love with solving problems since I was a young boy, from the smallest thing as washing dishes, or solving a math equation to landing on a new country. No matter how long it takes or how difficult the problem is, I always got to the finish line. I find that programming is not different, it also solves problems, but by other ways. I have learnt code for multiple years and I have had difficult times with it. Still, thanks for this huge commnunity and my willing to get everything done, there had been no problem that I could not solve. I believe I could offer a lot with my skills and willingess.   

I'm here to learn and help.
